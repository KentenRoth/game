## Character Types

All characters do the same amount of damage.

Every 3rd level increase your weapon damage, stealth, dodge, and block go up by 5 points until they reach the max for that character type.

#### Ninja

The ninja class has lowest max health, and deflects the least amount of damage, but increase in chance to dodge attacks, and highest chance of stealth damage (2x regular damage).

#### Warrior

The warrior is the middle ground. It blocks some incoming damage, it dodges some, and is the middle for max HP.

#### Viking

The Viking has the highest HP, very little stealth, an average amount of dodge, but a high level of blocking damage.
